## Continued development

I would have loved to use the image filter: hue-rotate() property to add a blueish hue to the picture. Unfortunately, the whole idea seems more like a guessing game for me at the moment rather than a calculable value.
I would also appreciate much if someone pointed me in the right direction how this solution could be done from a mobile - first point of view using the same flexbox technology.
